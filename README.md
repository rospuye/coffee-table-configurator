# Coffee Table Configurator

A polished 3D coffee table configurator built with React Three Fiber / Three.js. It features parametric tabletops (adjustable size & shape), material options including wood veneer, and smooth interactive controls. Inspired by modern coffee table designs, it demonstrates a minimal yet finished product customization experience.
